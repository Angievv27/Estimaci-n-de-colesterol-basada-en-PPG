# Cholesterol levels estimation via PPG-based features
This data set contains PPG recordings from 46 non-hospitalized subjects and is intended to support developing and validating approaches for estimating blood cholesterol levels by analyzing PPG signals.
# Data acquisition 
The data were collected in a laboratory (i.e., no individual was hospitalized) for 2 minutes at a sampling rate of 100 Hz.
# Description 
46 subjects (32 men and 14 women) were recruited to capture PPG signals and assess their cholesterol levels via blood-lipid test. The mean age was 56,93 ± 12,85 años. years. In addition, information was collected on whether they had been diagnosed with any cardiovascular risk factor and were undergoing any treatment. In the MSExcel file, "Datos_Registros_PPG.xlsx", the information regarding each subject is summarized as follows:
Record #: name of the record associated with each individual, 'sujeto##_PPG" (where ## is the subject's number).
Age: range between  years old.
Gender: Male or Female.
Treatment: 'y', is under treatment, on the other hand, 'n', isn’t under treatment.
Category: According to ATPIII Guidelines (low, medium, or high cholesterol level)
